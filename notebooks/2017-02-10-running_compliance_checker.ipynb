    "## Shore Station Compliance Checker Script\n",
    "\n",
    "The IOOS Compliance Checker is a Python-based tool that helps users check the meta data compliance of a netCDF file. This software can be run in a web interface here: https://data.ioos.us/compliance/index.html The checker can also be run as a Python tool either on the command line or in a Python script.  This notebook demonstrates the python usage of the Compliance Checker.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose: \n",
    "Run the compliance checker python tool on a Scipps Pier shore station dataset to check for the metadata compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scripps Pier automated shore station operated by Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System (SCCOOS) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) is mounted at a nominal depth of 5 meters MLLW. The instrument package includes a Seabird SBE 16plus SEACAT Conductivity, Temperature, and Pressure recorder, and a Seapoint Chlorophyll Fluorometer with a 0-50 ug/L gain setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies: \n",
    "This script must be run in the \"IOOS\" environment for the compliance checker to work properly.\n",
